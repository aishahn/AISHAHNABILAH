<center><h2> 𝄞⨾𓍢ִ໋  Music 🤘🏼</h2><center>
<p>I love music but I'm not good at playing musical instruments. I am very interested in handcore, metal, emo and rock genre. Among the music groups that I am very interested in are Muse, Bring Me the Horizon, Pierce the Veil, Alesana and others.</p>

<p> I enjoy bands like Muse, Bring Me the Horizon, Pierce the Veil, Alesana, and La Dispute because their music is emotionally intense, with powerful lyrics and dynamic sounds. They often explore deep themes, giving listeners a strong emotional release and a sense of connection to the music and its messages. <br></p>

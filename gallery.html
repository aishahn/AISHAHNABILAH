<center><h2>⋆ ˚｡⋆୨🎀୧⋆ ˚｡⋆ Picture when I was a child and had no problems🧸ྀི </h2><center>
<p> 

I was born in Kuantan, Pahang, in 2003. I am the eldest of 2 siblings. When I was born, my mother was only 20 years old, and my father was 24 years old.

I grew up in Kuantan for 5 years. There, my father worked as a lorry driver, and my mother was a housewife. In 2010, we moved to my parents' village in Felda Keratong 4. After only one year there, we moved to Felda Padang Piol, Jerantut, because my father was taking care of his grandmother. I spent 8 years growing up there, where I made many good friends.

In 2012, I finally got a little sister whom I had been eagerly waiting for. I was very happy. While growing up there, I learned many things, including the meaning of sacrifice because my mother worked in Kuala Lumpur for 2 years. At that time, I was 13 years old and took on the responsibility of caring for my younger sister, who was only 5 years old at the time.

However, in 2015, my father's grandmother passed away. As a result, my parents decided to move back to Felda Keratong 4, where I had the opportunity to attend school for 2 years over there to sit for the SPM . </p>

<center><h2>🫶🏻🥹❤️‍🩹 Picture when I was in high school at SMK Bandar Tun Razak ˚˖𓍢ִ໋🦢˚ </h2></center>
<p>I sat for the SPM at SMK Bandar Tun Razak. However, in 2020, Malaysia was hit by Covid-19, which caused us to postpone the exam to the following year. During my time at that school, I befriended a highly active and entertaining classmate. I also had the pleasure of being taught by an excellent and supportive teacher who was passionate about sports. </p>

<center><h2>˗ˏˋ ♡ ˎˊ˗ Picture of my friends and me in the form 6 at SMK Abu Bakar Temerloh 🦋 </h2><center>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>After completing SPM, I opted to pursue my studies at the STPM level. Initially, I received an offer for STPM at a school in Rompin, but I applied for a transfer to Temerloh. To this day, I have no regrets about choosing to move to SMK Abu Bakar, even though I didn't know anyone at the school initially. During my time striving through STPM, I met incredibly supportive and affectionate friends. The experiences with my friends are unforgettable. One of the most memorable moments was our frequent outings all the way to Kuala Lumpur. I still chuckle when I remember the mischief that got us kicked out of the dormitory. Hahaha! Moreover, I was deeply touched by how close-knit and helpful our classmates were in supporting each other academically. Undoubtedly, the time during Form Six was the most enriching experience of my youth. </p>

<center><h2>🎸⋆⭒˚｡⋆ Pictures when I go to concerts and gigs 🎧ྀི </h2><center>
<p align="center">Attending Muse's concert in Malaysia was electrifying. The band's energy, dazzling light shows, and epic soundscapes captivated the audience. "Knights of Cydonia" and "Starlight" were unforgettable, uniting everyone in a powerful, euphoric atmosphere. It was a night of musical brilliance for me <br>  </p>
<p align="center"> Attending my favourite gig, S4DATREX at REXKL on May 26, 2023, was amazing. The historic venue and the band's energetic performance created a thrilling atmosphere. The excited crowd and powerful music made it a night full of joy and excitement. </p>
